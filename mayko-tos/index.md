# Terms of Service – Mayko Webscraper
_Last updated: 2025-08-24_

## 1. Who we are
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Mayko Discord application/bot (“Service”), operated by ZeTroX16

## 2. Acceptance
By adding or using the bot, you agree to these Terms and all applicable platform rules (including Discord’s Terms & Guidelines). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 3. Description of the Service
The Service monitors selected third-party reseller pages (e.g., availability/price status) and posts updates/alerts to Discord channels or DMs you opt into. The Service is not affiliated with any reseller or Discord.

## 4. Your responsibilities
- Follow Discord’s rules and your local laws.  
- Do not use the Service to break third-party terms (including target websites’ terms) or any scraping/anti-bot restrictions.  
- Do not attempt to overload, reverse-engineer or abuse the Service.  
- Ensure you have the right to post any URLs or content you submit.

## 5. No warranties & availability
The Service is provided **“as is”** and **“as available”** without warranties of any kind. Price/stock data may be inaccurate, outdated or unavailable. We may suspend or change features at any time.

## 6. Limits & fair use
We may throttle, rate-limit, or restrict features to protect stability and prevent abuse.

## 7. Third-party content
Links to third-party sites are provided for convenience; we do not control or endorse them and are not responsible for their content or terms.

## 8. Intellectual property
We own the Service’s software, branding and content (excluding third-party marks/content). You may not copy, modify, or host derivative services without our prior written permission.

## 9. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access to the Service (including for violations or security reasons). You may stop using the Service at any time; removing the bot from your server stops further collection for that server. See the Privacy Policy for data deletion.

## 10. Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill arising from your use of the Service.

## 11. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms or third-party rights.

## 12. Changes to these Terms
We may update these Terms. Material changes will be indicated by updating the “Last updated” date and (where feasible) an in-bot notice. Continued use after changes means acceptance.

## 13. Contact
Questions about these Terms: **[admin@zetrox.dev]**.
