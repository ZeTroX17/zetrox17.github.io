# Privacy Policy – Mayko Webscraper
_Last updated: 2025-08-24_

**Controller**: ZeTroX16  
**Contact**: **admin@zetrox.dev**

This policy explains how we process personal data when you use the Mayko Discord application/bot (“Service”). We aim to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1) Data We Process
- **Discord identifiers & context**: user ID, username/handle, guild (server) ID, channel ID, and permission flags needed to run commands.
- **Command/interaction content**: parameters you send to the bot (e.g., URLs/products to track, alert preferences). We do **not** read general message history.
- **Service configuration**: tracker entries you create (per-user/per-server).
- **Operational logs**: short-lived technical logs (timestamps, error traces, request counts) for reliability and abuse prevention.

We **do not** collect emails, phone numbers, payment data, or messages unrelated to bot interactions.

## 2) Purposes & Legal Bases (GDPR)
- **Provide the Service** (execute commands, send alerts, store trackers) — *Art. 6(1)(b) contract* / *Art. 6(1)(f) legitimate interests*.  
- **Security & integrity** (rate-limiting, diagnostics, preventing abuse) — *Art. 6(1)(f) legitimate interests*.  
- **Compliance** (responding to lawful requests) — *Art. 6(1)(c) legal obligation*.

## 3) Storage & Retention
- **Trackers & preferences**: kept **only while** an item is actively tracked. If you remove a tracker (or remove the bot from a server), the associated data is removed in the normal course of operation.  
- **Operational logs**: retained for a short period necessary to troubleshoot and ensure stability, then deleted or anonymized.

**Development storage**: locally hosted  
**Production storage**: hosted at **Hetzner** (EU).

## 4) Sharing & Processors
We share data only as necessary to run the Service:
- **Discord** (platform through which interactions occur).  
- **Infrastructure/hosting**: **Hetzner** (production).  
Processors act on our instructions and do not get to use the data for their own purposes.

## 5) International Transfers
Discord may process data outside the EU/EEA. Where applicable, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect your information.

## 6) Your Rights (GDPR)
Subject to conditions and exceptions, you can request: **access**, **rectification**, **erasure**, **restriction**, **objection**, and **data portability**.  
To exercise your rights, see **Contact** below and include your **Discord user ID** (and server ID, if relevant) so we can locate your data.

## 7) Data Deletion – How to Remove Your Data
- Remove your **tracker entries** (the data disappears when the tracking stops), or remove the bot from your server to remove server-bound configuration.  
- If you need help or want us to delete residual data, contact us and we’ll handle it.

## 8) Security
We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures (least-privilege access, secure secret handling, transport security). No method is perfectly secure, but we work to protect your data.

## 9) Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. We will adjust the “Last updated” date and, where feasible, announce material changes via the bot or repository.

## 10) Contact
For privacy requests or questions, contact **admin@zetrox.dev**. If you are in the EU/EEA, you may also lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
